    <section id="about" class="about">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>We are a student-led technology team participating in Imagine Cup 2025 with a strong interest in innovation, learning, and real-world problem solving. Our team is composed of motivated students who are passionate about software development and artificial intelligence. We believe that technology, when used responsibly, can solve meaningful problems and create positive impact for individuals and communities.</p>
                
                <p>As students, we bring curiosity, adaptability, and a strong willingness to learn. We actively explore modern technologies and apply them through academic projects, self-learning, and hands-on development. Imagine Cup provides us with an opportunity to transform our ideas into a practical solution while gaining valuable experience in teamwork, creativity, and technical execution.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Technical Skills</h3>
                <p>Our team's core technical skills include JavaScript, artificial intelligence, machine learning, bot development, and general software development. JavaScript is one of our primary programming languages and is used for building interactive user interfaces, backend services, and application logic. We focus on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code that supports scalability and long-term development.</p>
                
                <p>Artificial intelligence plays an important role in our approach. We use AI to enable intelligent features such as automation, data analysis, and decision support. Our understanding of AI allows us to design systems that can learn from data and improve performance over time. We focus on practical AI applications that add real value rather than unnecessary complexity.</p>
                
                <p>Machine learning is used to analyze data, identify patterns, and generate meaningful insights. Our experience includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and improvement. We carefully select appropriate algorithms based on the problem and aim to build models that are efficient, reliable, and interpretable.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Development Process</h3>
                <p>In addition, we have experience developing bots and automated systems. These bots are designed to interact with users, respond to requests, and automate repetitive tasks. By combining bot technology with AI and machine learning, we aim to improve efficiency, accuracy, and user experience across different use cases.</p>
                
                <p>Our development process follows basic software engineering principles. We begin by understanding the problem and defining clear objectives. We then design a solution, develop a working prototype, test it under different conditions, and improve it based on feedback. Collaboration and communication are key strengths of our team, and we work together to ensure that each part of the system integrates smoothly.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                <p>Ethical responsibility is important to us, especially when working with artificial intelligence. We are committed to respecting user privacy, handling data responsibly, and designing systems that are fair and transparent. We believe AI should support human decision-making and be used in ways that benefit society.</p>
                
                <p>Participating in Imagine Cup 2025 is an important learning opportunity for our team. Through this experience, we aim to strengthen our technical skills, improve our ability to work as a team, and gain exposure to real-world challenges in technology development. We view this competition not only as a challenge, but also as a platform for growth and innovation.</p>
                
                <p>In conclusion, we are a dedicated student team with skills in JavaScript, artificial intelligence, machine learning, bot development, and software engineering. Our goal in Imagine Cup 2025 is to build an intelligent, practical, and responsible solution that demonstrates creativity, technical ability, and social value.</p>
